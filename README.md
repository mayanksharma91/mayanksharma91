- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @mayanksharma91
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m a product manager interested in web development and data science.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning javascript, node.js, and Hugo.
  - I'm building a chat bot on Telegram which helps you remember your tiny wins.
  - I'm also building my personal website and blog using Hugo after realising that Ghost is overkill for me.
